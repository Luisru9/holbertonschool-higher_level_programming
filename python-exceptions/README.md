In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception occurs, the program's normal execution is halted, and the control flow is transferred to a special block of code designed to handle the exception.

Exceptions are used to manage errors and unexpected situations in a more controlled and organized manner. Rather than letting a program crash when it encounters an error, Python allows developers to catch and handle exceptions, providing an opportunity to gracefully respond to issues and continue the program's execution.

Key components related to exceptions in Python include:

Try Block:

The block of code where exceptions might occur is enclosed within a try block.
Except Block:

The except block follows the try block and contains the code to handle specific exceptions that might be raised.
Raise Statement:

The raise statement is used to explicitly raise an exception at a specific point in the code.
Finally Block:

The finally block, if present, contains code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is useful for cleanup operations.
Exception Types:

Python has a variety of built-in exception types, such as TypeError, ValueError, ZeroDivisionError, etc., each representing a specific kind of error.
